## Technical Details

### Responsive Design Implementation

- **Typography**: Responsive font sizes and spacing

### Key Patterns Used
```tsx
// Responsive grid layout
sx={{ 
  display: 'grid', 
  gridTemplateColumns: { 
    xs: 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 
    sm: 'repeat(2, 1fr)', 
    md: 'repeat(4, 1fr)' 
  }, 
  gap: { xs: 1.5, md: 2 } 
}}

// Conditional rendering for mobile/desktop
<Box sx={{ display: { xs: 'none', md: 'block' } }}>
  {/* Desktop content */}
</Box>
<Box sx={{ display: { xs: 'block', md: 'none' } }}>
  {/* Mobile content */}
</Box>

// Mobile FAB positioning
<Fab
  sx={{
    position: 'fixed',
    bottom: 16,
    right: 16,
    display: { xs: 'flex', md: 'none' }
  }}
/>
```

### Component Architecture
- **Container-based Layout**: Consistent max-width and padding
- **Card-based Design**: Modern card layouts throughout
